Below are the steps that I followed to Resolve SSIS issue.
1.Creating a new AppPool in IIS for application.
2. Creating Windows Authentication Logins in the SQL Server.
3.Craeting User for above Login in SSMS.
4. Granting the db_ssisoperator Database Role for above Users.

By using above steps we can connect DB server for Script task. 
After that we faced excel file permission issue (the files are located in fs002 server) , to fix this issue we modified file security by adding EVERYONE user with full control.

Then the magic worked and we are able to execute SSIS package successfully through IIS application.
